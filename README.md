#### **_Description_**
Glow Worm is a classic snake game... in the dark! It is meant to add several degrees of challenge to the classic snake game -- both for the player, and for the coder. 

Navigate your worm through the grid, looking for food by the glow of your worm's head. Gain points and add length to your tail with every morsel eaten, and feel the speed of the game rachet up with every level conquered. Be careful, though -- there are different types of food. Some is worth more points than others. Some food is poison, and will deduct points from your score. Some increases your glow or speed, while other food decreases it. Two more foods generate for every food eaten, so soon the board is full of obstacles and treats alike. How long can you survive?
