    initWorm()
        Get random coordinates for worm head in left half of grid, without worm tail going past edge
        Establish worm head at random coordinates
        Set initial worm direction to 'right'
        Set initial worm speed to STARTING_SPEED
        Set initial glow area to STARTING_GLOW_AREA

        runTimer()
    
    runTimer()
        Set interval of 1 second
        Increment timer seconds
        If seconds reach 60, increment timer minutes and reset seconds to 0


**Functions - Render**

    renderGrid()
            Get rows and columns from GRID_SIZE
            Generate divs
            Assign all divs ids with coordinates
            Initialize innerHTML of all divs to ''
            Append divs to gridEl
    
    renderWorm()
        renderWormHead()
        renderWormTail()

    renderWormHead()

        renderGlow()

    renderGlow()
        Remove existing glow
        getAdjacentSquares(wormhead coordinates)
        For each adjacent square (except worm head and worm tail), apply glow CSS class

    getAdjacentSquares()
        Set empty array
        Loop through adjacent squares offset from worm head based on STARTING_GLOW_AREA
        Push adjacent squares into array

    renderWormTail()
        Apply worm tail CSS class to grid squares in worm tail array

    renderFood()
        Get random position for food (that isn't already occupied)
        Select random food type
        Populate innerText of div at food position with symbol from food type


**Functions - Game Play**

    moveWorm()
        Clear interval
        Set new interval based on worm speed
        Calculate new worm head position based on direction

        Check if new worm head position is outside grid
            if yes, gameOver() and return

        Check if new worm head position is eating its own tail
            if yes, gameOver() and return

        Check if new worm head position is eating food
            if yes, eatFood()

        Otherwise, move normally
            Pop last segment from worm tail array
            Unshift old worm head position to worm tail array
            Update worm head with new position
            renderWorm()

    eatFood()
        Check symbol of food eaten

        Add new segment to worm tail array
    
    updateCurrentScore()
        Add points earned/lost to Score
        If current score is > high score, updateHighScore()
        If current score is > current level * POINTS_FOR_LEVEL_UP, levelUp()
